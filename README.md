Creating a quiz game to help me learn about the process of building a simple application and create something fun
This is a web-based football quiz game where players are challenged to guess the correct match based on clues provided over 5 turns. Players have to guess the teams that participated in the match while progressively revealing more details about the match with each incorrect guess. This project is built with mobile-first design principles but is also adaptable for desktop use.

Features

Daily Match: One classic football match is featured per day.
Progressive Clues: Each incorrect guess reveals additional clues, such as tournament name, venue, scorers, and more.
Multiple Team Name Variants: Supports different spellings and abbreviations for team names.
Mobile-First Design: Optimized for mobile devices with a responsive layout for desktop play.
Simple Admin Interface: Up to 7 matches can be input manually or via CSV upload, and each match is scheduled to go live automatically.
How to Play

Players are presented with an input box where they can type the names of the teams they believe played in the match.
With each incorrect guess, a new clue is revealed (e.g., the venue, year, tournament, etc.).
Players have 5 guesses to correctly identify the match.
